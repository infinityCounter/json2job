Quickly convert JSON to a job!

# Features:

1. You can keep all your resume information separate from it's layout in a JSON file.
2. Once you give json2job your resume JSON file and the desired theme, it will output an HTML resume for you.
3. Dont like the layout of your resume? You can simply choose a different theme. This has advantages over using Word because:
    * If you wanted to completely change the look of your resume in Word, you may need to redo your resume from scratch because the content is intertwined with the presentation
    * json2job allows you to keep the content of your resume separate from its presentation.
    * You can easily upload your resume to your website because it's really just another webpage (although you will need to upload the generated `resources` folder in addition to the HTML file).
4. You can simply use your browser's print-to-pdf feature to save the resume as a PDF file.
5. A web frontend is being developed :)
6. Can run as a server.
    * You can send your JSON resume as a POST request to /webresume and get a full zip containing the HTML file and its resources.

### Server Usage:

    java -jar json2job.jar --input whatever --server-mode --server-port optional_server_port

*The server will listen to port 8080 by default*

Then send send a POST request to `localhost:8080/webresume`. That will return the html file for your resume. Then send a GET request to `localhost:8080/resources` to get a zip file containing the css/js/etc used to make the resume look pretty.

In the same folder where you downloaded the html file, create a directory called "resources" and extract the contents of the resources zip file to the new resources folder. Then simply open up your web resume html file in your browser.


#### Configuring SSL in the Server:
To make json2job use ssl, you need to set the `json2job_keystore_location` and `json2job_keystore_password` environment variables.
To create a keystore from an existing letsencrypt certificate, run the following:

    openssl pkcs12 -export -out keystore.p12 -inkey privkey.pem -in fullchain.pem
    keytool -importkeystore -destkeystore MyDSKeyStore.jks -srcstoretype PKCS12 -srckeystore keystore.p12

Set the json2job_keystore_location and json2job_keystore_password variables to the location and password of the new keystore respectively.

Then finally to load json2job in SSL mode, pass `--server-mode --ssl-mode` to the jarfile.

### Usage:

    java -jar json2job.jar --input example.json --output output

### Output:

![default_theme_output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infinityCounter/json2job/master/screenshots/1_default_theme_latest.png)

### Compiling

You can either compile it using Intellij IDEA or Maven.

#### Compiling using Maven

1. Clone the repository.
2. `cd` into the repository.
3. Install `maven`.
4. Run `mvn package`.
5. You can then utilize the jarfiles in the `target` subdirectory.

### Customizing the Output:



#### Customizing Section Headings
You can customize the various headings by adding the following to your resume JSON file:

1. skillsHeading
2. jobWorkHeading
3. volunteerWorkHeading
4. projectHeading
5. educationHeading
6. accomplishmentsHeading
7. hobbiesHeading

Example:

    {
      "skillsHeading": "Custom Skills Heading",
      "jobWorkHeading": "Custom Work Heading",
      "accomplishmentsHeading": "Custom Accomplishments Heading",
      "projectsHeading": "Custom Projects Heading",
      "hobbiesHeading": "Custom Hobbies Heading",
      "person": {
        "name": "Bob",
        "email": "johndoe@gmail.com",
        "address": "7 Java Drive, OOP City",
        "phoneNumber": "+1(334)567-2346",
        "jobTitle": "Software Engineer",
        "website": "https://www.google.com",
        "objective": "Bleh bleh bleh bleh bleh bleh bleh bleh"
      },
      ...


Output:

![custom_headings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infinityCounter/json2job/master/screenshots/custom_theme_heading_example.png)

### Converting to PDF

#### Converting to PDF With Browser
You can just open the webresume HTML file in your browser, press Ctrl+p and then follow your browser's instructions.
I personally prefer Chrome's PDF creation capabilities.


#### Converting to PDF Without Browser (Experimental)

If you don't want to use your browser to save the web resume as a pdf, you can install phantomjs and do the following:

    phantomjs pdf.js <webresume_file>.html <pdf_resume_file>.pdf

pdf.js is in the root directory of the json2job directory.

## Creating a new Theme.

1. Create a new file in the `themes` folder and give it a name of <new_theme_name.html>
2. Examine the contents of `themes/default.html` to see how themes work
3. Put any resources you may want to use in the resources/resources.zip .
4. Link your resources properly by using `config.resourceDirectory`. For example, the following links to a file that is in the root directory of `resources/resources.zip`:

`<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="${config.resourceDirectory}/fonts.css">`
